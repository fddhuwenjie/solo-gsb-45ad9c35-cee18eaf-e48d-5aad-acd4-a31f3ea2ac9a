"""Ingestion orchestration for the ``POST /events`` write path.

:class:`EventIngestionService` sequences one event write end to end:
contract-triplet validation, contract resolution and payload validation,
the idempotency decision, the event insert, the state-machine projection
and the alert-rule recomputation, plus selection of the session the event
lands in. The service is transport-agnostic and holds no application
state: the SQLite connection is passed per call and its two collaborators
-- the contract resolver and the session builder -- are injected
callables, so the service never owns a module-level connection or an
application-global cache (the parsed-schema cache stays with the app
factory that supplies the resolver).

The *caller* owns the transaction: the route opens ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``,
calls :meth:`EventIngestionService.ingest`, and commits on success or
rolls back on any error, so the idempotency decision, the insert, the
projection and the alert recomputation are always committed or rolled
back together. Domain outcomes are reported as
:class:`~app.contracts.ContractError` (the route maps it to 422) and
:class:`IngestionConflict` (mapped to 409); unexpected exceptions
propagate so the caller rolls back as well.
